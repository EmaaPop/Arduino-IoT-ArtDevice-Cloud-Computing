# Arduino-IoT-art-device for ELEC0017-Connected Systems
## Module Description:
The modern world is full of connected systems. They underpin the information revolution and drive advances from the way we do business to the way we deliver healthcare.

This module will introduce students to connected systems by providing a comprehensive coverage of the systems and technologies that build modern communications networks. Specifically, it covers the state-of-the-art technologies of the internet of things as well as the applications that are enabled by it.

On completion of this course, students should be able to:
- Identify the elements of a connected system architecture.
- Make suitable choices of technologies for different applications.
- Produce a small connected system using high level tools.
===========================================

Prompt: Develop a small connected system using the components you have and the Arduino Cloud

Criteria: Demonstrate a design of an **end-to-end connected system** to serve a specific application. You can propose **any IoT project** you would like to work on. The only restrictions are that you must use the **Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 board and the Arduino Cloud**.

### Description:
Technology is always changing and as it does, art reflects that. As we are a team made of a computational artist and an engineer interested in art, we wanted to combine those 2 worlds and make an art device that uses cloud computing to bring this technology to the public in a creative interactive way. Art also has the responsibility of introducing new technologies to the masses and increasing the possibilities of using those.. Therefore, we believe it is essential that artists, engineers and computer scientists work together to inspire each other. 

### How it works:
1. Records the ambient temperature in real time through temperature sensors, and send that data to Arduino Cloud and reflects changes in the color of LED locally.
2. Detect the movement of pets through infrared motion sensors and control the movement of motors to increase the interaction with them.
