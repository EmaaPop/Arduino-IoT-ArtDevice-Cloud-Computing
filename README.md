Technology is always changing and as it does, art reflects that. As we are a team made of a computational artist and an engineer interested in art, we wanted to combine those 2 worlds and make an art device that uses cloud computing to bring this technology to the public in a creative interactive way. Art also has the responsibility of introducing new technologies to the masses and increasing the possibilities of using those.. Therefore, we believe it is essential that artists, engineers and computer scientists work together to inspire each other.
